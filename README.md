# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and Welcome!

Some of of the of the stuff I made:

## NPM packages

### noby-ui-kit

The npm page for the package ca be found [here][nobyuikitlink].

A shocase page with most of the components can be viewed [here][nobyuikitshowcase].

#### Description

Accessability and customization is the main focus

All components by default with aria props.

Any of the styling can be overwritten (recommended with Styled Components). None of the headaches when needing to change the styling juts a bit. One of the motives behind this package are the frustration with other UI kits like Material UI when it comes to adding your unique twist.

## Fitbit clock faces

### Dots

The clockface can be found [here][dotsclockfacelink].

#### Description:

Dots, dots and dots.

The ring shows how active have you been in the past hour. The more steps you made in the certain minute, the brighter and more dots will get in the respective section.

The actual color of the dots show how close your are to beating your steps goal considering the time of day. Green for on track, orange for lacking behind and red for being only about half way.

Top left dots are showing the battery level.

Top right dots are representing the heart rate zones. Next step, to reflect the zones set up in the profile. Haptic feedback when the heart rate is the highers range.

At the bottom in the center the default stats (steps made, calories burned, ...) can be cycled through by tapping on it. Haptic feedback on tap, to confirm a successful input.

#### Description:

A simple yet elegant and easy to read clockface.

You can color every element individually if you desire.
